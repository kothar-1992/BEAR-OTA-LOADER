# Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Verification

### 1. Anti-Detection Measures Verification

#### A. StealthLibraryManager Testing
```bash
# Test stealth randomization
adb logcat | grep "StealthLibraryManager"

# Verify file randomization works
# 1. Download libbearmod.so file
# 2. Check if randomized copy is created
# 3. Verify original file is cleaned up
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Original libbearmod.so files are randomized before injection
- ✅ Randomized files have different names/paths each time
- ✅ Original files are securely deleted after randomization
- ✅ No traces of original file names in memory/logs

#### B. SignatureVerifier Testing
```bash
# Test signature verification
adb logcat | grep "SignatureVerifier"

# Test with valid and invalid signatures
# 1. Test with legitimate PUBG APK
# 2. Test with modified/fake PUBG APK
# 3. Verify certificate pinning works
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Legitimate PUBG signatures are verified correctly
- ✅ Modified/fake signatures are rejected
- ✅ Certificate pinning prevents signature spoofing
- ✅ User-friendly error messages for signature failures

### 2. Permission Security Testing

#### A. Android 8.0+ Compatibility
```bash
# Test on Android 8.0+ device
# 1. Install app on Android 8.0+ device

# 3. Verify permission detection works correctly
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission requested correctly
- ✅ Permission status detected accurately
- ✅ Settings navigation works on all Android versions
- ✅ Graceful fallback for older Android versions

#### B. Permission Workflow Testing
```bash
# Test complete permission workflow
# 1. Start with no permissions granted
# 2. Use "Grant Security Permissions" button
# 3. Grant permissions one by one
# 4. Verify app detects changes immediately
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All required permissions are requested
- ✅ Permission status updates in real-time
- ✅ Button states reflect permission status

#### C. PUBG Variant Testing
**Test Matrix**:
```
Device Type    | PUBG Global | PUBG Korea | PUBG Vietnam | PUBG Taiwan
Real Device    |     ✅      |     ✅     |      ✅      |     ✅
LDPlayer       |     ✅      |     ✅     |      ✅      |     ✅
BlueStacks     |     ✅      |     ✅     |      ✅      |     ✅
```

## Final Security Checks

### 1. Code Obfuscation Verification
```bash
# Build release APK with ProGuard/R8
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Verify obfuscation worked
# 1. Decompile APK using jadx or similar
# 2. Check if sensitive class names are obfuscated
# 3. Verify KeyAuth credentials are not plaintext
```

**Security Requirements**:
- ✅ Class names and method names are obfuscated
- ✅ String literals are encrypted/obfuscated
- ✅ KeyAuth credentials are not easily extractable
- ✅ Native library loading is protected

### 2. Network Security Testing
```bash
# Test network security
# 1. Monitor network traffic during KeyAuth communication
# 2. Verify HTTPS is used for all KeyAuth API calls
# 3. Test certificate pinning (if implemented)
# 4. Verify no sensitive data in network logs
```

**Security Requirements**:
- ✅ All KeyAuth communication uses HTTPS
- ✅ No sensitive data transmitted in plaintext
- ✅ Certificate validation works correctly
- ✅ Network errors handled securely

### 3. Memory Security Testing
```bash
# Test memory security
# 1. Monitor memory dumps during operation
# 2. Check for sensitive data in memory
# 3. Verify proper cleanup of sensitive data
# 4. Test memory protection mechanisms
```

**Security Requirements**:
- ✅ License keys are not stored in plaintext in memory
- ✅ Downloaded files are cleaned up properly
- ✅ Sensitive strings are cleared after use
- ✅ No debug information in release builds

## Performance and Stability Testing

### 1. Memory Usage Testing
```bash
# Monitor memory usage
adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.bearmod.loader

# Test for memory leaks
# 1. Navigate between activities multiple times
# 2. Download files multiple times
# 3. Monitor memory usage over time
# 4. Check for memory leaks using profiler
```

**Performance Requirements**:
- ✅ Memory usage stays under 100MB during normal operation
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
