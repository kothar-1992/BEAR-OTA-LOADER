## 🐻 Project Overview

**BearMod-Loader** is an advanced modular Android patching and modding tool designed for secure, dynamic modification of Android applications. It leverages native code, Frida scripting, and robust authentication to enable ethical security research, dynamic feature deployment, and automated patch management.

> **Purpose:**  
> - Enable dynamic app patching and analysis for security researchers and advanced users  
> - Provide a modular, scalable architecture for UI, native patching, and cloud-based updates  
> - Automate building, testing, and deployment with CI/CD pipelines  
> - Enhance anti-detection and anti-tampering capabilities for analysis and modding

## 🏗️ Getting Started (Build & Development)

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** 2023.1.1 or later
- **JDK 17** or later
- **Android NDK 25.1.8937393**
- **Git** for version control

### 🔨 Quick Build (Simplified)

#### Windows
```batch
# Build debug APK
build.bat debug

# Build release APK
build.bat release

# Clean project
build.bat clean

# Run tests
build.bat test
```

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# Build debug APK
./build.sh debug

# Build release APK
./build.sh release

# Clean project
./build.sh clean

# Run tests
./build.sh test
```

### Manual Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BearOwner/BearMod-Loader.git
   cd BearMod-Loader
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Open the root folder.
   - Let Gradle sync all modules.

3. **Configure the NDK**
   - Set up the NDK path in Android Studio under `Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK > SDK Tools`.

4. **Build the app**
   - Use Android Studio’s Build menu, or:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

5. **Run locally**
   - Connect an Android device (with USB debugging enabled).
   - Run via Android Studio or:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

### Native & Frida Scripts

- Native code builds automatically with the app using CMake.
- To use Frida scripts, ensure you have `frida-server` running on your device and use scripts in the `scripts/` directory as needed.

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

1. **Launch BearMod-Loader on your device.**
2. **Authenticate and select the target APK.**
3. **Apply or configure patches via the UI or CLI.**
4. **Monitor logs and output for patch application status.**
5. **For dynamic runtime patches:**  
   - Use Frida scripts, e.g.  
     ```sh
     frida -U -f com.target.app -l scripts/bypass-signkill.js --no-pause
     ```
6. **View update/patch status in the app or via CI logs.**
